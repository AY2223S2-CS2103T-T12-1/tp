Patientist is a desktop app used for managing patients and staff within a medical facility. This application is optimised 
for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to fall back 
on. If you are a strong typist and are familiar with the system, Patientist can get your tasks done faster and more 
reliably than traditional GUI based apps.

# Patientist User Guide
## Notes about formatting
* Words in UPPER_CASE are user supplied parameters, e.g. `addpat n/NAME`: `NAME` is a parameter, and the command can be used as add `n/John Doe`
* Items in square brackets are optional parameters, e.g. `addpat n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `addpat n/John Doe t/urgent` or simply as `addpat n/John Doe`
* Items with … after them can be specified 0 or more times, e.g. `[t/TAG]...` means it is valid to not include a tag, or you can chain 1 or more `t/TAG` expressions
* Extraneous parameters for commands that take in exactly 0 parameters will be ignored
# Features:

## Viewing help: help
Shows a popup explaining how to access the user guide, which is the help page.

Format: `help`

## Adding a patient: addpat
Adds a new patient to the system, and places them in the `WARD_NAME` assigned.
Should `WARD_NAME` not be specified, the user is added into a default list of patients that has no ward assigned to them.
Tags attached to a user are meant to be short notes that do not fit into any other category of patient details that can be added.

**Warning: `WARD_NAME` is case sensitive.** `block B ward 2` will refer to a different ward from `Block b Ward 2`.

### Format: `add n/PATIENT_NAME pid/PATIENT_ID_NUMBER [w/WARD_NAME] [t/TAG]...`

`PATIENT_ID_NUMBER` should be unique to each patient. This is not case sensitive. A123456789B is identical to a123456789b.
**This input will be capitalised automatically.**\
`PATIENT_NAME` need not be unique.

### Examples:
`addpat n/Jonathan Lee pid/A12345679B`\
`addpat n/Jonathan Lee pid/A12345679B w/block B ward 2`

---
## Adding prescriptions/instructions for patient: addpresc
Adds `PRESCRIPTION_OR_INSTRUCTION` in the prescriptions and instructions field for the `PATIENT` specified.
The patient can be specified by `PATIENT_ID_NUMBER`, the patient’s ID number.
(Consider changing this in future iterations to not having to key in prescription in CLI, instead a new editpresc command opens a text editor for the patient’s txt prescription file)

`addpresc pid/A0123456789B p/paracetamol 500mg`
