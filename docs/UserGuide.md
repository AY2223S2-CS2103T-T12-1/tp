title: Patientist User Guide
---
Patientist is a desktop app used for managing patients and staff within a medical facility. This application is optimised
for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to fall back
on. If you are a strong typist and are familiar with the system, Patientist can get your tasks done faster and more
reliably than traditional GUI based apps.

# Features

## Notes about formatting
* Words in UPPER_CASE are user supplied _arguments_, e.g. `addpat n/NAME`: `NAME` is an _argument_, and the command can be used as add `n/John Doe`
* Items in square brackets are optional _arguments_, e.g. `addpat n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `addpat n/John Doe t/urgent` or simply as `addpat n/John Doe`
* Items with … after them can be specified 0 or more times, e.g. `[t/TAG]...` means it is valid to not include a tag, or you can include 1 or more `t/TAG` expressions
* Extra _arguments_ for commands that take in exactly 0 _arguments_ will be ignored, e.g. `help 0` will bring up the help window as with just `help`
