### Project: Patientist - hospital management system

Patientist is a patient management system that seeks to unify data management in medical facilities.
Admin and medical staff alike will find this application useful due to the myriad of features available,
yet being fast and lightweight to use due to its optimisation for Command Line Interface (CLI) interaction.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Adds Patient's todo list
  * Add a todo field to patient on the UI display when viewing the patient's details
  * Add relevant commands to logic to support adding and deleting todo for patients
  * Add relevant components to store todos in Storage
  * Add relevant fields to model for patient to keep track of their todo list

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Extended the existing functionality in AB-3's model for storing contacts such that it can support multiple wards
  * Extended the types of `Person` in AB-3 such that `Person` is abstract, and the Model manages `Patient` and `Staff` instead
  * Redefined the API `Model` to conform with new operations involving `Wards`

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2023-02-17&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=euph00&tabRepo=AY2223S2-CS2103T-T12-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
